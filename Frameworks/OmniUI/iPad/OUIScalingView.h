// These methods are confusingly named; -transformToRenderingSpace actually returns a transform that will take you *from* rendering space to UIKit's  view coordinate system, but that's the transform you want to concat with the CTM in order to "be in" rendering space when you draw (that is, to "go to rendering space"). Likewise -transformFromRenderingSpace returns a transform that will convert a point's coordinates in UIKit's space *to* the same point's coordinates in rendering space.
